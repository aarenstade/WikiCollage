# WikiCollage

WikiCollage is a simple graphics (collage) editor with an open access contribution model.
Every topic has a unique 5000 x 5000 pixel image which anyone can contribute to.

## Current functionality:

- Click anywhere to add an empty image, then select a file or paste a url.
- Translate/scale images and scroll/scale the entire collage
- View list of added elements with their positions and sizes.
- Search topic, fetch latest additions, and display current collage.
- "Cooldown" period after new topic additions.
- Connect a wallet (MetaMask, etc) using [(https://www.npmjs.com/package/@usedapp/core)]

## Things to build / being built:

- Smart contract to issue ERC20 "WC" tokens.
- Formula to evaulate contributions (collages or code) to issue WC tokens.
- Admin control with whitelisted wallet addresses.
- Mechanism for admins to mint NFTs w/ shared contributor ownership (proportional to area contributed).
- Scrollable history to view previous additions and permalinks for each.

# Other stuff to do

- General code organization and better commenting.
